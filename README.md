## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See the latest updates of games
- Able to read complete details of a selected game
- Have a community to share thoughts


### Links

- Source Code: [source code](https://github.com/muubaraq/insidious)
- Live Site URL: [live url](https://insidious-games.netlify.app/)

## My process
Create some rough designs. Before i get into the website creation process, it helps to have the basic layout and visual style worked out. Creating these sketches can range from drawing them on a napkin to creating mockups in Photoshop. Create a flowchart to show how the basic navigation of the site will work.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
